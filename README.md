# ESP-WebSDR

Browser spectrum viewer and firmware installer for ESP32 chips, with live
FFT spectra, waterfalls, tuning, gain and bandwidth controls.

With the help of LLMs, we discovered an undocumented feature in Espressif's
ESP32 chips that bypasses the fixed-function modems to capture raw IQ baseband
samples. ESP-WebSDR pairs with the [ESP-SDR firmware](https://github.com/ESPARGOS/esp-sdr)
to display these samples as a live spectrum and waterfall in your browser,
turning supported ESP32 boards into low-cost software-defined radio receivers.

**Parts of this code are AI-generated.**
While we put a lot of manual effort into [pyespargos](https://github.com/ESPARGOS/pyespargos) and the firmware for our ESPARGOS One arrays, we don't have the time to manually review all of the source code for ESP-WebSDR.

## Get started

1. Use a browser with Web Serial support (Chrome or Edge on a computer) or
   Chrome on Android, and connect your board over USB. On Android, use a USB OTG
   cable or adapter; the pages talk to the board through WebUSB there.
2. Install the matching firmware with the [firmware installer](https://espargos.net/espsdr/app/flash.html).
3. Open the [viewer](https://espargos.net/espsdr/app/), connect to the board, and select a frequency.

The installer also includes the **ESP32-S31 Ethernet / USB profile for
[SoapyESPSDR](https://github.com/ESPARGOS/SoapyESPSDR)**. Select that profile to
stream continuously to desktop SDR applications. It has its own receiver
control page at the board's DHCP address and does not use this serial viewer.

ESP32-C2 / ESP8684 boards are supported over UART, with up to 8,190 I/Q samples
and 256–2048-bin snapshot FFTs at 80/40/16 MS/s. The packaged C2 firmware requires
a 26 MHz crystal; the installer checks the crystal before writing. For CH340
bridges, use **Switch to 1 Mbaud** when the viewer reports transfer errors.
C2 analog bandwidth covers approximately 12–20 MHz; zero selects the open
capacitor setting. Controls are negotiated, so older C2 images retain their
80 MS/s-only capability and disabled bandwidth control.

On Android, ESP-WebSDR includes WebUSB drivers for native USB Serial/JTAG and
other CDC-ACM devices (including CH9102/CH343), CP210x, CH340/CH341 and FTDI
bridges. On dual-channel FTDI bridges such as ESP-Prog, it uses channel B, the
UART. Prolific PL2303 bridges are not supported on Android. See
[docs/android-support.md](docs/android-support.md) for how it works and how to
test it from a phone.

Close other programs using the serial port. If automatic bootloader entry fails,
hold BOOT, tap RESET, then release BOOT and reconnect in the installer.

See the [ESP-SDR guide](https://espargos.net/espsdr/) for supported chips and setup.

ESP32-H2 uses its Bluetooth PHY capture engine at 32, 16, approximately
10.667, and 6.4 MS/s (rate codes 7, 6, 8, and 9),
with up to 16,380 complex samples and 256–2048-bin snapshot spectra. Both
native USB Serial/JTAG and UART0 (TX GPIO24, RX GPIO23) are supported.
The installer includes an H2 image for 2 MB or larger flash. The analog bandwidth control covers approximately 4–11 MHz; zero selects
the widest filter setting. Lower rates are hardware subsampling without
automatic anti-alias filtering. Continuous capture is not advertised. On a TX/RX-only adapter,
enter download mode with BOOT/RESET before installation and reset afterward;
the adapter cannot control the board's reset pins.
